What I learned in the Biomedical Regulatory Affairs Program: IND, Investigational New Drug


So, what is an IND?
IND stands for Investigational New Drug. It’s a formal request to the FDA for authorization to start clinical trials in humans.
It’s regulated under 21 CFR 312.
You’ll need an IND for any study involving a drug or biologic in humans for therapeutic use
Okay, I’m going to file an IND. But when exactly?
Short answer: After preclinical studies, before you initiate your investigation on first human subject

Do I Qualify for an IND Exemption?
Filing an IND can be a tedious process, I totally understand. But if your clinical investigation uses a marketed drug in the US, there’s a good chance you may be exempt from submitting an IND, if the following criteria are all met:

You do not intend to:

expand the indication for use, or make any significant change to the labeling.
make any significant change in the advertising for the drug.
change the route of administration, dosage level, or target population in a way that significantly increases risk
*Note: Not only increasing, but also decreasing the dose level could augment the risk profile

And your investigation must:

Follow IRB approval and informed consent requirements (21 CFR 50 & 56).
Comply with the FDA’s rules against promotion of investigational drugs (21 CFR 312.7).
→ In other words, if your investigation is for academic or non-commercial research, and it does not involve any changes to the indication, dosage, route of administration, or target population, and does not introduce additional risk, you may qualify for an IND exemption.

I think my case is exempt from IND, now what?
Generally, the sponsor can assess whether their study qualifies for an IND exemption.

Some guidance may help with the assessment, for example:

IND Exemptions for Studies of Lawfully Marketed Drug or Biological Products for the Treatment of Cancer
Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND
If you determine that your study meets the exemption criteria, you may proceed without notifying the FDA.

However, if you’re unsure, ASK!!

Consult the FDA through either a formal or informal route:

Formal: file an IND but with a request of IND waiver. If the FDA agrees with your exemption request, they will issue an official exemption letter.
Informal: Reach out via email, phone, or during a pre-IND meeting. These interactions provide non-binding feedback—helpful but not definite.
Consult the IRB:

All human studies must be reviewed by an IRB, regardless of IND exemption status.
The IRB can assist in evaluating exemption eligibility, but only the FDA has the final authority.
Not just any IND, you have to submit the right type:
Commercial IND
Your ultimate goal is to get FDA marketing approval for a new drug. This IND supports a NDA or BLA submission.
Research IND (also known as non-commercial IND)
Your study aims to improve scientific understanding or medical practice.
If your study doesn’t meet the exemption criteria, a research IND is still required. In other words, whether an IND is required depends on your study design, regardless of whether the purpose is commercial or non-commercial.
Expanded Access IND (also called “compassionate use”)
For patients with serious or life-threatening conditions with out approved treatment options, an expanded access IND could make a new but unapproved drug available to them.
It generally is submitted by the physician.
What to submit? let me introduce you “IND package”
FDA 1571: the main document of IND
General Investigational Plan
Investigator’s Brochure (IB)
Protocol
CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control): quality
Drug Substance
Drug Product
Label: must state “for investigational use only”
Environmental analysis: assess potential impact on the environment during manufacturing or after use/metabolism
Pharmacology & Toxicology: preclinical data
Clinical experience
Form 3674: the status of clinical trial registration
(Form 1572):
– Commercial IND → not required at submission, but often collected later for inspection
– Non-commercial IND → required to initiate the IND
IND format
eCTD
Stands for: Electronic Common Technical Document
Purpose: Standardizes submission format across ICH (International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use) regions to improve consistency and reduce FDA review burden
– Original ICH members: US, EU, Japan
– Taiwan is now also an ICH regulatory member
Who uses it?
– Commercial IND → Required
– Non-commercial IND → Encouraged, but not mandatory
Scope of content:
– For IND submission, only a few sections of eCTD are needed
– For NDA/BLA, all modules must be complete
Traditional Format
Paper-based or scanned PDF format
Only available to non-commercial INDs (no drug-approval intention)
eCTD Module Overview
Module 1:Administrative and regional documents (not technically part of “eCTD” core)
Includes: FDA Form 1571, General Investigational Plan, Investigator’s Brochure (IB), Label, Environmental Assessment, Form 3674, Form 1572
Module 2: Overviews and summaries
Summarizes: Protocol, Pharmacology & Toxicology, Clinical Experience, CMC
Module 3: Quality
Includes: CMC, Drug Substance, Drug Product
Module 4: Nonclinical study reports
Includes: Pharmacology & Toxicology
Module 5: Clinical study reports
Includes: Protocol, Clinical Experience
*M2=M3+M4+M5


eCTD module overview
Something about Form 3674
It basically certifies that you will register your trial on ClinicalTrials.gov.

Who Needs to Register?

Only “applicable clinical trials” (ACT) need to be registered. Here are the ACT criteria:

The trial is interventional
– Most psychological studies are observational → no need for registration.
The trial phase is other than Phase 1
The product in the investigation is regulated by the FDA
The product is manufactured or exported from the US; or the investigation site is in the U.S.
Since Form 3674 is required to initiate an IND, for those clinical trials that don’t need to be registered, just check “Not Applicable” on the form.
What happens after you submit an IND?
The FDA has 30 calendar days to review your IND.
Technically, if the FDA does not respond within 30 days, you may proceed with your clinical trial and ship your product.
it’s strongly recommended to wait for an official response before step into clinical stage.
If the IND is acceptable, the FDA will send an acknowledgment letter to the sponsor.
*note: the FDA does not “approve” INDs, they “acknowledges” them.

If the FDA has concerns, the FDA may issue:

Clinical Hold: Once resolved the concerns, the trial can continue.
Termination: it requires a new IND submission to proceed.

The IND review process
Clinical Hold / IND Withdrawal / IND Termination
Similarity: All of them can occur at any time.

Clinical Hold
Issued by the FDA
Temporarily suspends the investigation(s)
Could be due to: Safety concerns, Unqualified investigators, Errors in the Investigator’s Brochure, Inadequate risk assessment, and Potential reproductive impacts
Once the issues are resolved and reviewed by FDA, the investigation may proceed. (No new IND needed)
IND Withdrawal
Initiated by the sponsor
Could be due to safety concerns or commercial strategy (e.g., financial reasons)
If withdrawal is safety-related → IRB must be notified; If not → IRB does not need to be notified
If you want to start the investigation in the future → submit a new IND
IND Termination
Initiated by the FDA
Typically due to: Serious safety issues, Fake data or protocol violations, Failure to respond to FDA’s deficiency letters, Conducting the study without FDA authorization
The IND is shut down completely → must submit a new IND to proceed again
You think you can leave it behind after submitting it? Nah
There are some things you need to keep focusing on after submission.

IND Annual Report
Celebrate your IND’s birthday by filing an annual report
Submit it within 60 days of the IND activation date
For example: filed on 1/1 → IND goes active on 1/31 → report due by 3/31 next year
IND Safety Report
Use Form 3500A
Unexpected, fatal or life-threatening adverse reaction → submit it in 7 days
Other serious, unexpected risks → 15 days
Amendment
Protocol Amendment
When do you need one?

New protocol: Protocol changes that may affect: subject safety, the scope of the investigation, scientific quality (like endpoints)
Adding a new investigator
If the changes are major, protocol amendment might not be enough → you may need a new IND
Information Amendment
For essential updates that don’t fit under safety reports, protocol amendments, or annual reports
